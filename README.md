# Trivia_Question_Game_Maker
# In this program I am creating a program to play a trivia game. the data file that contains 
# a number of trivia questions, and I am making a game that  allows the user to pick a number 
# of trivia questions and then determine if they are correct or not.
# Each question will be stored internally as an object, and it will take control of the ability to 
# determine if the chosen answer is correct or not. It will also have a constructor to parse the 
# input string and break it into its component parts.
# The main program will take care of reading the file, creating the storage for all the questions, 
# and asking the user how many questions
